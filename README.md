## Machine Learning cases in various Industries

### Automotive Industry
Problem: Predict the CO2 emission of a car that has not been manufactured yet, but we are interested in estimating its approximate CO2 emissions after production, just by importing other characteristic fields, such as the engine size, the number of cylinders and the fuel consumption.

- code:

Problem: Determine which existing vehicles on the market are most like the prototypes on automobile manufacturer has developed for a new vehicle; which models the manufacturer will be competing against. The goal is to summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacturers to make decisions about the supply of new models.
