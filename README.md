## Machine Learning cases in various Industries

### Automotive Industry
*Problem*: Predict the CO2 emission of a car that has not been manufactured yet, but we are interested in estimating its approximate CO2 emissions after production, just by importing other characteristic fields, such as the engine size, the number of cylinders and the fuel consumption.
- **dataset**: FuelConsumption.csv
- **code**: Regression - Predict Car CO2emission.ipynb

*Problem*: Determine which existing vehicles on the market are most like the prototypes on automobile manufacturer has developed for a new vehicle; which models the manufacturer will be competing against. The goal is to summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacturers to make decisions about the supply of new models.

- **code**: Clustering on Cars dataset.ipynb

### Telecommunication Industry
*Problem*: Predict the class of a new customer of a telecommunication provider, in case the company categorizes its customers into four groups, so as to predict group membership and customize offers for individual perspective customers.
- **dataset**: teleCust1000t.csv
- **code**:  	KNN Classification for new customers.ipynb

*Problem*: Predict which customers might leave a telecommunication provider next month. Customer churn has many definitions: customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection. They are all referring to the loss of clients or customers. This can be due to voluntary reasons (by choice) or involuntary reasons (for example relocation). Predictive analytic models can be used to predict customer churn by assessing their propensity or risk to churn.

- **code**:  	Customers Churn Prediction.ipynb

### MEDIA - RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
*Problem*: Build a movie recommendation system for a user, based on MovieLens dataset.
- **dataset**: MovieLens dataset 100K
- **code**:  	Recommendation Systems on a Movie dataset.ipynb
